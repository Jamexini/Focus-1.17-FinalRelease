this is the timer for focus and stuff to stop scrolling and be productive or whatever. Developed by Jamexini media embed: Roblox: https://www.roblox.com/users/934119970/profile  Discord: jamexini IP: fukyou.823.634.153

how to get it on chrome:
1. download the files from here: "https://github.com/Jamexini/Focus-1.17-Release" 1. click "Code" green button, download zip, UNZIP it with winrar. -- if you already have a old version of Focus, first remove it for the sake of not having duplicates. You can keep both if you want and then turn off the old one c:
2. open chrome and type chrome://extensions in the bar at top or go to extension icon, manage extensions.
3. look at the top right for developer mode toggle and turn it on
4. click the load unpacked button that shows up left
5. pick the folder called Focus (make sure its the Focus folder not "Focus ...", inside of it should be the files so select that folder)
6. it should show up now so just pin it to your bar and lock in

that is all really hope you like it :)
